# Marco: A Stochastic Asynchronous Concolic Explorer

Concolic execution is a powerful program analysis technique for code path exploration. Despite recent advances that greatly improved the efficiency of concolic execution engines, path constraint solving remains a major bottleneck of concolic testing. An intelligent scheduler for inputs/branches becomes even more crucial. Our studies show that the previously under-studied branch-flipping policy adopted by state-of-the-art concolic execution engines has several limitations. We propose to assess each branch by its potential for new code coverage from a global view, concerning the path divergence probability at each branch. To validate this idea, we implemented a prototype Marco and evaluated it against the state-of-the-art concolic executor on 30 real-world programs from Googleâ€™s Fuzzbench, Binutils, and UniBench. The result shows that Marco can outperform the baseline approach and make continuous progress after the baseline approach terminates.

## Build

TODO

<!-- 
Because SymSan leverages the shadow memory implementation from LLVM's sanitizers,
it has more strict dependency on the LLVM version. Right now only LLVM 12 is tested.

### Build Requirements

- Linux-amd64 (Tested on Ubuntu 20.04)
- [LLVM 12.0.1](http://llvm.org/docs/index.html): clang, libc++, libc++abi

### Compilation

Create a `build` directory and execute the following commands in it:

```shell
$ CC=clang-12 CXX=clang-12 cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release /path/to/symsan/source
$ make
$ make install
```

### Build in Docker

```
docker build -t symsan .
```

### LIBCXX

The repo contains instrumented libc++ and libc++abi to support C++ programs.
To rebuild these libraries from source, execute the `rebuild.sh` script in the
`libcxx` directory.

**NOTE**: because the in-process solving module (`solver/z3.cpp`) uses Z3's C++ API
and STL containers, so itself depends on the C++ libs. Due to such dependencies,
you'll see linking errors when building C++ targets when using this module.
Though it's possible to resolve these errors by not instrumenting the dependencies
(adding them to the [ABIList](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/DataFlowSanitizer.html#abi-list),
 then rebuild the C++ libs), we don't recommend using it for C++ targets.
Instead, it's much cleaner to use ann out-of-process solving module like Fastgen. -->

## Test

### Hybrid Fuzzing
TODO

TODO
<!-- 
To verify the code works, try some simple tests
(forked from [Angora](https://github.com/AngoraFuzzer/Angora),
adapted by [@insuyun](https://github.com/insuyun) to lit):

```
$ pip install lit
$ cd your_build_dir
$ lit tests
```

### Environment Options

* `KO_CC` specifies the clang to invoke, if the default version isn't clang-12,
  set this variable to allow the compiler wrapper to find the correct clang.

* `KO_CXX` specifies the clang++ to invoke, if the default version isn't clang++-12,
  set this variable to allow the compiler wrapper to find the correct clang++.

* `KO_USE_Z3` enables the in-process Z3-based solver. By default, it is disabled,
  so SymSan will only perform symbolic constraint collection without solving.
  SymSan also supports out-of-process solving, which provides better compatiblility.
  Check [FastGen](https://github.com/R-Fuzz/fastgen).

* `KO_USE_NATIVE_LIBCXX` enables using the native uninstrumented libc++ and libc++abi.

* `KO_DONT_OPTIMIZE` don't override the optimization level to `O3`.



SymSan needs a driver to perform hybrid fuzzing, like [FastGen](https://github.com/R-Fuzz/fastgen).
It could also be used as a custom mutator for [AFL++](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus)
(check the [plugin readme](driver/aflpp/README.md)). -->
